…","the discussion on fouad chehab begins at 10:06.

in the fourth edition of our historical figures’ series, nizar and ben analyze the life and legacy of fouad chehab, the army commander turned lebanese president, who in his presidency from 1958 to 1964 enacted a reform agenda that transformed the lebanese state. 

a romanticized figure, famous for his state-building agenda, the lebanese view of fouad chehab says more about the modern-day state of the country than how it was in the 1950s/60s.

we also talk the streisand effect, for those in lebanon who try and to bury a story through defamation charges and all but guarantee it winds back up in the press. the ongoing dispute between the government and the generator owners also escalated this week, with the seizure of the first two generators for non-compliance. some good news in the mix: kafa has secured cross party support for an amendment to the domestic violence law. cabinet, meanwhile, remains stalled on the question of the six sunni mps.

also out this week, the lebanese association for democratic elections (lade) have released a damning report on the may parliamentary elections, critiquing the law, the implementation of it, and the chaos of the election itself. we take a mini deep dive into the conclusions of the report, given our own start as an elections podcast. 

and as this is the last episode of season one—tlpp will be returning for a second season in mid-january—we thought it would be a good time to reflect on the politics of 2018, the obsession with the elections in the run up, and the inability to translate the results into a workable government since. because really, what was the point of 2018?

with nizar globetrotting once again, the twenty-ninth episode of the lebanese politics podcast sees regular host benjamin redd joined by guest nasser yassin, the director of research at the issam fares institute, to analyse the news of the past week before diving deep into an incredibly important topic for lebanon: refugees. 

we start with analysis of the sewage mess in ramlet el-baida, the theater of politicians blaming each other, and the oversight role parliament should be playing, before looking at the other pollution stories, including zahle’s berdawni river turning red for the second time this year, nahr al-kalb’s stint as green, and the decades of pollution in the litani. also covered, an update on the e-transaction law we discussed in episode 26—even the politicians who helped pass it agree the law is flawed—and the latest on cabinet formation, with the ongoing issue of sunni representation meaning there is no end in sight. 

with the syrian refugee crisis in it's eight year, we look at the impacts, real and perceived, on the host communities, how the media, donors, and the refugees themselves are becoming fatigued, how populist rhetoric is not actually based on the experiences of the poor lebanese who share their space with syrian refugees, and why the issue of returns is more fraught than many are willing to admit.

in the twenty-eighth episode of the lebanese politics podcast, benjamin redd and nizar start with analysis of big political speeches by nasrallah and hariri and what they mean for cabinet formation—with zero compromise from the former and a surprisingly tough riposte from the latter. also discussed is parliament’s new session and passing a law for the disappeared, new funds for edl, a lawyer’s strike, the shock reconciliation between frangieh and geagea, and the us ramping up its anti-hezbollah rhetoric. 

our main topic—in light of the 75th anniversary of lebanese independence on november 22— is whether lebanon has ever truly been an independent state. we go through the history of the past 75 years and analyse why exactly it is that lebanon lends itself to proxy politics and meddling from the outside.

tick tock goes the cabinet clock—with the christian representation problem solved it seemed like a new cabinet was finally on the horizon but now the issue of sunni representation has taken the forefront, with hezbollah staunching refusing to allow cabinet formation to go ahead without a resolution. in the twenty-six episode of the lebanese politics podcast, benjamin redd and nizar hassan analyze whether this was a tactical error on hezbollah’s behalf, placing the blame for cabinet delay on their door step. 

also discussed is the shocking acquittal of the husband of roula yaacoub, who had been accused of beating his wife to death five years ago—and whether the swift response of the state prosecutor was a victory for activist pressure—the scapegoating of syrians in light of a controversial news report, cuts to electricity due to a lack of government funds for fuel, a new powerplant project by american company primesouth, jounieh’s ignominious place as the 23rd most polluted city in the world, and newly released figures on refugee returns.
